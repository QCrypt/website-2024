Abstract: The area of revocable cryptography is concerned with representing cryptographic keys as quantum states with the guarantee that it is infeasible to give away a state representing a key without losing its functionality. Recently, many revocable cryptographic notions have been studied in the context of traditional and advanced encryption systems, signatures and pseudorandom functions. In this talk, I'll discuss the recent developments in revocable cryptography and mention some open problems in this area. 


Bio: Prabhanjan Ananth is an assistant professor in the department of computer science at UCSB. Previously, he was a postdoctoral associate at MIT and graduated with a Ph.D. from UCLA. He works on quantum cryptography, and is particularly interested in the topics of unclonable cryptography and pseudorandomness.
