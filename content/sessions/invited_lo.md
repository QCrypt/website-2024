Abstract: Modulator side channels threaten the security of quantum key distribution systems. Here, I first review a newly discovered modulator side channel for any practical bandwidth-limited modulator. After that, I present an overview of the recent development of the general theory and experiment on fully passive quantum key distribution, which removes modulator side channels completely by eliminating any modulators that carry secret information. Such a general theory is applied to different use cases: continuous variable, BB84, twin-field (TF), and measurement-device-independent (MDI)-QKD. Proof-of-principle experimental demonstrations are also discussed.
