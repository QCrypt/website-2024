Abstract: The semi-device-independent approach to quantum information protocols is based on the idea that all quantum devices are uncharacterized up to a mild and/or reasonable assumption. Examples can be limitations in Hilbert space dimension, energy or fidelity. In this talk, we discuss the different assumptions used to build semi-device-independent frameworks for quantum information, how they give rise to quantum-over-classical advantages, the main types of techinques used to characterise the limitations of quantum correlations, and the applications of these resouces to cryptographic tasks such as quantum key distribution and quantum random number generation.

Bio: Armin Tavakoli (1993, Sweden) is since 2023 Assistant Professor at Lund University, Sweden. He obtained his PhD in 2020 at University of Geneva and was then a postdoc at IQOQI Vienna and TU Vienna. His main research work is in the field of quantum correlations, on topics such as nonlocality, entanglement, quantum communication and quantum networks.
