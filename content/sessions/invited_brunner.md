Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has reached a maturity that requires to consider its practical integrability into optical communication networks. As a key exchange, QKD cannot take the central role in optical network design but has to adapt to the requirements of the network.
In the framework of the Madrid Quantum Communication Infrastructure (MadQCI) the CV-QKD prototypes of HWDU were demonstrated in operational environments. These prototypes support several key features for facilitating network integration. Among these features are the coverage of typical metro link losses with automatic adaptation to the channel conditions as well as in-channel synchronization, which reduces the spectral needs to a single dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) channel. In many situations, this fully C-band tunable channel can simply be connected to a free multiplexer port of an existing DWDM infrastructure. Any-to-any connectivity between many QKD transmitters and receivers can reduce the number of devices, while dynamic protocol switching allows to address different security requirements and cryptographic tasks.
 
Bio: Hans H. Brunner is a principal research engineer at the Munich Research Center of Huawei Technologies Duesseldorf GmbH (HWDU). He is the architect and leading engineer of the CV-QKD prototypes developed at HWDU, his research focuses on CV-QKD implementations and networks. Brunner received the B.Sc., Dipl.-Ing. (M.Sc.), and Dr.-Ing. (Ph.D.) degrees in electrical engineering from Technical University of Munich (TUM) in 2005, 2007, and 2016, respectively.
