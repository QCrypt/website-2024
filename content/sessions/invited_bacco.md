Abstract: In a society based on the continuous exchange of sensitive data and information, the importance of secure and trustable communications is essential. By exploiting principles of Quantum Physics, it is possible to share data in an unconditionally secure way, no longer based on mathematical assumptions of the encryption algorithm, but founded on the basic principles of Quantum Mechanics. In this context, my research relies on the development of a Quantum Communication (QCs) system able to increase the actual performance in terms of rate, security, and distance independently from the transmission medium. The key to exceeding the barriers of present QCs resides in the extensive knowledge of high-speed classical optical communications merged with future technologies based on photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Indeed PICs represent one of the most practical and scalable opportunities for advances in quantum technologies thanks to their enhanced performance in terms of stability, complexity, and scalability. In this talk, I will present the latest research on quantum integrated photonics technologies including high-dimensional quantum communication in fiber and free-space links.
 
 
Bio: Davide Bacco is an Associate Professor at the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Florence and co-founder of QTI s.r.l., the first Italian startup developing and commercializing quantum communication systems. He received his degree in Engineering Telecommunication in 2011 at the University of Padova, Italy. In 2015 he finished in the same University the Ph.D. degree on Science Technology and Spatial Measures (CISAS). He has been working at the Department of Electronics and Photonics Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) for the last 7 years. His research interests regard quantum communications, quantum cryptography and integrated photonics for quantum communications.
