Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) and randomness generation (RNG) protocols involve the production of certified randomness. But how can we accurately and efficiently quantify the randomness we produced against an unknown eavesdropper? In this tutorial we will investigate the problem of computing rates of QKD and RNG protocols in different security paradigms. We will introduce the relevant entropy optimization problems that characterize rates and explore some of the techniques that have been developed to solve them.  

Bio: Peter Brown received his PhD from the University of York (UK) in 2019 and he is currently an Assistant Professor at Télécom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris). His main research interests lie within quantum information and quantum cryptography. In the latter he focuses on the development of mathematical techniques for security proofs with a particular emphasis on device-independent protocols.
