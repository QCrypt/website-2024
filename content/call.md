## Goal of the Conference

QCrypt is a conference for students and researchers who work on quantum cryptography, broadly defined. We invite research contributions on the possibilities and limitations of quantum methods for secure communication and computation. (Research on classical post-quantum cryptography is considered to be within scope if it makes innovative use of quantum information concepts.) QCrypt features both experimental and theoretical talks.

## Contributed Talks and Posters

QCrypt solicits submissions of extended abstracts describing recent research results in quantum cryptography. These will be reviewed by the program committee, which will select a small number of contributed talks, and a larger number of poster presentations. The selection will be based on the scientific merit of the submissions, keeping in mind the desire to create an attractive and balanced program. A small number of submissions may be upgraded to invited talks at the discretion of the PC chairs and of the steering committee.

In line with the goal of showcasing the best results each year from all subfields, the conference has no published proceedings. Yet, contributed talks are highly competitive. QCrypt welcomes the submission of any interesting and important result, while allowing researchers from a wide range of disciplines to pursue publication in any venue appropriate to their field.


**By default, QCrypt 2024 will be an on-site conference, and it is requested that the authors of accepted papers give an in-person presentation at the conference. Exceptions will be made only if special circumstances prevent the authors from attending the conference.**

Poster Size:  Posters should be no wider than 1 meter and no higher than 1.2 meters to fit comfortably on the poster support boards.

## Submission Instructions
All submissions should be in PDF (Portable Document Format). An extended abstract for a talk submission should be 2-3 pages, in A4 or letter size, using reasonable margins and at least 11pt font. (The 3-page limit does not include references.) An extended abstract for a talk should give a non-technical, clear and insightful description of the results and main ideas, their impact, links with prior and concurrent work (if any) and their importance to quantum cryptography.

For a “poster only” submission, a one-page non-technical description is sufficient as an extended abstract.

The extended abstract may refer to technical details which are presented elsewhere. In particular, authors may include citations to a full version of the paper that is either published, available on arXiv.org or provided as an attachment (links to full versions on personal webpages are not accepted). This is strongly recommended for theory submissions to help the peer-review process. The extended abstract should not be a compressed version of the full-length paper.

<!-- <strong>Submissions will be handled in EasyChair. A link to the submission server will appear here when the server is open.</strong> -->

<!-- The submission server will be open soon. -->

## Student Paper Prize
Since 2011, QCrypt features a prize for the best student submission. A submission is eligible for the student prize if and only if the main author(s) is/are a student(s) at the time of the submission, will present the work at QCrypt, and further a significant portion of the work must have been done by said student(s), including contributions to the key ideas. More details can be found in the <a href="/charter/#student-paper-prize">Charter</a>.

<!--
"Poster only" submissions will be accepted after the notification for talks (7th June). For these submissions,  a one-page non-technical PDF is sufficient as the extended abstract.


Extended abstracts should be submitted electronically here using the EasyChair system (if the link doesn’t work, visit https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qcrypt2019 directly).
