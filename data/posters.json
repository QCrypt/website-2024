        "title": "Entropy bounds for device-independent quantum key distribution with local Bell test",
        "abstract": "One of the main challenges in device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) is achieving the required Bell violation over long distances, as the channel losses result in low overall detection efficiencies. Recent works have explored the concept of certifying nonlocal correlations over extended distances through the use of a local Bell test. Here, an additional quantum device is placed in close proximity to one party, using short-distance correlations to verify nonlocal behavior at long distances. However, existing works have either not resolved the question of DIQKD security against active attackers in this setup, or used methods that do not yield tight bounds on the keyrates. In this work, we introduce a general formulation of the key rate computation task in this setup that can be combined with recently developed methods for analyzing standard DIQKD. Using this method, we show that if the short-distance devices exhibit sufficiently high detection efficiencies, positive key rates can be achieved in the long-distance branch with lower detection efficiencies as compared to standard DIQKD setups. This highlights the potential for improved performance of DIQKD over extended distances in scenarios where short-distance correlations are leveraged to validate quantum correlations.",

        "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables the expansion of cryptographic keys between two parties, allowing for proven secure communication. The main downside of QKD protocols is their vulnerability to attacks that target the physical implementation. Device Independent Quantum Key Distribution (DIQKD) is a new paradigm addressing this issue by relaxing assumptions on the physical implementation. First DIQKD experiments were reported in 2022, proving the feasibility of DIQKD. However, these experiences required highly sophisticated setups. Here, we analyse the suitability of a novel optical implementation for DIQKD. Our results show that DIQKD could be realized with a simple setup using only commercially available hardware.",

        "title": "Signatures From Pseudorandom States via ⊥-PRFs",
        "abstract": "Different flavors of quantum pseudorandomness have proven useful for various cryptographic applications, with the compelling feature that these primitives are potentially weaker than post-quantum one-way functions. Ananth, Lin, and Yuen (2023) have shown that logarithmic pseudorandom states can be used to construct a pseudo-deterministic PRG: informally, for a fixed seed, the output is the same with 1 − 1/poly probability. In this work, we introduce new definitions for ⊥-PRG and ⊥-PRF. The correctness guarantees are that, for a fixed seed, except with negligible probability, the output is either the same (with probability 1 − 1/poly) or recognizable abort, denoted ⊥. Our approach admits a natural definition of multi-time PRG security, as well as the adaptive security of a PRF. We construct a ⊥-PRG from any pseudo-deterministic PRG and, from that, a ⊥-PRF. Even though most mini-crypt primitives, such as symmetric key encryption, commitments, MAC, and length-restricted one-time digital signatures, have been shown based on various quantum pseudorandomness assumptions, digital signatures remained elusive. Our main application is a (quantum) digital signature scheme with classical public keys and signatures, thereby addressing a previously unresolved question posed in Morimae and Yamakawa’s work (Crypto, 2022). Additionally, we construct CPA secure public-key encryption with tamper-resilient quantum public keys.",

Our method is specifically tailored towards low-level hardware implementations, e.g. on FPGAs or microcontrollers, and requires only very little RAM and basic CPU instructions, like additions and bit-shifts. No floating-point operations, as is the case for FFT-based approaches, are needed. Offset revovery with iQSync typically only requires a few thousand iterations over a simple loop and evaluates with sublinear average-case computational complexity, improving on previous results with super-linear complexity. We implemented our method on our real-time QKD platform and demonstrate excellent agreement with theoretically derived success probabilities for channel attenuations exceeding 70 dB.",

In this paper, we introduce a quantum analog of UPFs, which we call unpredictable state generators (UPSGs). UPSGs are implied by pseudorandom function-like states generators (PRFSs), which are a quantum analog of pseudorandom functions (PRFs), and therefore UPSGs could exist even if one-way functions do not exist, similar to other recently introduced primitives like pseudorandom state generators (PRSGs), one-way state generators (OWSGs), and EFIs. In classical cryptography, UPFs are equivalent to PRFs, but in the quantum case, the equivalence is not clear, and UPSGs could be weaker than PRFSs. Despite this, we demonstrate that all known applications of PRFSs are also achievable with UPSGs. They include IND-CPA-secure secret-key encryption and EUF-CMA-secure MACs with unclonable tags. Our findings suggest that, for many applications, quantum unpredictability, rather than quantum pseudorandomness, is sufficient.",

        "abstract": "The conventional point-to-point setting of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) typically considers two directly connected remote parties that aim to establish secret keys. However, almost all digital communication tasks involve multiple nodes and complex network architectures. Thus, it is essential to adapt and integrate QKD protocols and their security analyses to accommodate these complex environments and ensure secure communication across interconnected systems. This work proposes a natural generalization of a well-established point-to-point discrete modulated (DM) continuous-variable (CV) QKD protocol to the multi-party setting. We explore four different trust levels among the communicating parties and provide secure key rates in lossy and noisy channels. Our study shows that discrete modulated CV-QKD is a suitable candidate to connect several dozens of users in a point-to-multipoint network, achieving high rates at low cost, using off-the-shelf components employed in modern communication infrastructure.",

Public-key quantum money allows anyone to perform verification, while the private-key setting restricts the ability to verify to banks, as in Wiesner's original scheme. The current state of technological progress means that errors are impossible to entirely suppress, hence the requirement for noise-tolerant schemes. We show for the first time how to achieve noise-tolerance in the public-key setting. Our techniques follow Aaronson and Christiano's oracle model, where we use the ideas of quantum error correction to extend their scheme: a valid banknote is now a subspace state possibly affected by noise, and verification is performed by using classical oracles to check for membership in \"larger spaces.\" Additionally, a banknote in our scheme is minted by preparing conjugate coding states and applying a unitary that permutes the standard basis vectors.",

        "abstract": "High-dimensional entanglement promises not only increased key rates but overcoming some of the obstacles faced by modern-day quantum communication. Typically, key rates are computed via convex optimization procedures, which inherently limits the dimensionality one can analyze through computational constraints. Recent progress in high-dimensional photonics far exceeds these limitations and brings forth a need for (semi-)analytic methods to compute key rates in the regime of large encoding dimensions. We present a flexible analytic framework facilitated by the dual of a semi-definite program, enabling the computation of key rates in high-dimensional systems. This method, whether purely analytical or semi-numerical, hinges on diagonalizing specific operators influenced by entanglement witnesses and efficiently solving an optimization problem. To facilitate the latter, we show how matrix completion techniques can be incorporated to yield effective and computable bounds on the key rate in paradigmatic high-dimensional systems of time- or frequency-bin entangled photons and beyond.",

        "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables provable secure communication but faces challenges in device characterization, posing potential security risks. Device-Independent (DI) QKD protocols overcome this issue by making minimal device assumptions but are limited in distance because they require high detection efficiencies, which refer to the ability of the experimental setup to detect quantum states. Our study explores an entanglement-based one-sided device-independent QKD scenario, where one party's device is semi-trusted, while the second is completely untrusted. We introduce specific assumptions about the semi-trusted device's measurements and assess the security of our protocol without post-selecting outcomes, thereby allowing one to prove security against coherent attacks. By applying the latest analytical and numerical methods, we established that our protocol can securely operate as long as the involved detection efficiencies exceed a minimal threshold of 50.1% specifically on the untrusted side. This is almost the theoretical limit achievable for protocols with two untrusted measurements and is within current experimental capabilities. Interestingly, we also show that, by placing the source of states close to the untrusted side, our protocol is secure over distances comparable to standard QKD protocols. Our findings not only reinforce the practicality of QKD systems under less stringent conditions but also serve as a feasible hybrid approach, bridging conventional QKD with DI QKD.",

        "abstract": "Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV QKD) using optical coherent detectors is practically favorable due to its low implementation cost, flexibility of wavelength division multiplexing, and compatibility with standard coherent communication technologies. However, the security analysis and parameter estimation of CV QKD are complicated due to the infinite-dimensional latent Hilbert space. Also, the transmission of strong reference pulses undermines the security and complicates the experiments. In this work, we tackle these two problems by presenting a time-bin-encoding CV protocol with a simple phase-error-based security analysis valid under general coherent attacks. With the key encoded into the relative intensity between two optical modes, the need for global references is removed. Furthermore, phase randomization can be introduced to decouple the security analysis of different photon-number components. We can hence tag the photon number for each round, effectively estimate the associated privacy using a carefully designed coherent-detection method, and independently extract encryption keys from each component. Simulations manifest that the protocol using multi-photon components increases the key rate by two orders of magnitude compared to the one using only the single-photon component. Meanwhile, the protocol with four-intensity decoy analysis is sufficient to yield tight parameter estimation with a short-distance key-rate performance comparable to the best Bennett-Brassard-1984 (BB84) implementation.",

In this scheme, the entanglement generation and swapping protocols utilize entangled cat states produced using electro-optic modulation of single-mode optical cats. In our analysis, we adapt the approach of doubling the number of links that reduces complexity of constructing the final network and simplifies analytical treatment. In order to evaluate the mean waiting time, we employ both the mean-only approximation and exact results and determine the values of the success probabilities of entanglement generation and swapping at which the approximate results are close to the exact ones. Distance dependence of  the repeater rate is calculated depending on the number of elementary links. The results are used to perform a comparative analysis of quantum repeater schemes using the modulated cat states and the photon-pair states generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. It is shown that the use of the cat states provides several advantages over the photon pairs. Entanglement purification protocols for optical cats are discussed.",

This fundamental mechanism facilitates high-efficiency counterfactual quantum communication that information delivery without particle transmission through the channel. Regrettably, the original protocol left the weak trace of particles in the channel; fortunately, an upgraded counterfactual communication protocol eliminates this issue by modifying the structure unit according to two-state vector formalism~(TSVF). However, no study has realized the application of the quantum Zeno effect in weak-trace-free counterfactual communication to achieve efficient information transmission. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate weak-trace-free counterfactual communication via the quantum Zeno effect on a nanophotonic chip, achieving a transmission probability of 74.2 ± 1.6% for bit 0 and 85.1 ± 1.3% for bit 1.

However, the experimental complexity and low efficiency associated with synchronous detection of multipartite entanglement state have significantly hindered the practical application. Here, we propose a measurement-device-independent conference key agreement protocol utilizing asynchronous Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state measurement and achieve a linear scaling of the conference key rate among multiple parties, which has the similar performance with the single-repeater scheme in quantum network.  The asynchronous measurement strategy bypasses the necessity for complex global phase-locking technologies, concurrently extending the intercity transmission distance with composable security in finite key regime. Our work also showcases the advantages of the asynchronous pairing concept in multiparty quantum entanglement.",

As current e-commerce schemes are vulnerable to computational attacks, quantum cryptography, ensuring information-theoretic security against adversary's repudiation and forgery, provides a solution to this problem. However, quantum solutions generally have much lower performance compared to classical ones. Besides, when considering imperfect devices, the performance of quantum schemes exhibits a notable decline. Here, we demonstrate the whole e-commerce process of involving the signing of a contract and payment among three parties by proposing a quantum e-commerce scheme, which shows resistance of attacks from imperfect devices. Results show that with a maximum attenuation of 25 dB among participants, our scheme can achieve a signature rate of 0.82 times per second for an agreement size of approximately 0.428 megabit.

        "abstract": "Quantum network allows for multi-user applications  that bring advantages that are unattainable with a classical network. A crucial application of quantum networks is quantum conference key agreement (QCKA), which enables remote nodes to efficiently share information-theoretic secure group key by leveraging the laws of quantum mechanics. However, the efficacy of QCKA is hampered by inherent losses in optical fibers and the increasing number of users, impacting both bit rate and range. Here we introduce multi-field (MF) QCKA scheme, where independently sets of phase-randomized optical fields are  generated at remote locations, later combining them at a central measuring station. Employing the post-measurement pairing technique, we post-select optical fields with the same random phase, establishing Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger  correlations to distill a secret conference key.  This method ensures that the communication efficiency of MF-QCKA scales linearly with communication transmittance and remains independent of the number of users. Using components similar to twin-field quantum key distribution, MF-QCKA can be  implemented in a practial and scalable fashion. For three-user scenario, our protocol can overcome the performance limitation of QCKA without quantum memory  in the finite regime. By mitigating the impact of optical fiber losses and accommodating a larger user base, MF-QCKA protocol represents a promising step forward in the realm of quantum communication, ensuring secure and efficient parallel communication in complex quantum networks.",

We provide a security proof against coherent attacks and compute the achievable key rate in a finite size setting, i.e. with a finite number of rounds. To this end, we employ the generalized entropy accumulation theorem, as well conic optimisation, providing us with improved key rates compared to previous works.

Moreover, results such as QIP = QIP(3) (STOC’00) show that quantum resources significantly help in such a task. In this work, we initiate the study of round compression of protocols in the bounded quantum storage model (BQSM). In this model, the malicious parties have a bounded quantum memory and they cannot store the all the qubits that are transmitted in the protocol Our main results in this setting are the following: 1. There is a non-interactive (statistical) witness indistinguishable proof for any language in NP (and even QMA) in BQSM in the plain model. We notice that in this protocol, only the memory of the verifier is bounded. 2. Any classical proof system can be compressed in a two-message quan- tum proof system in BQSM. Moreover, if the original proof system is zero-knowledge, the quantum protocol is zero-knowledge too. In this result, we assume that the prover has bounded memory. Finally, we give evidence towards the “tightness” of our results. First, we show that NIZK in the plain model against BQS adversaries is unlikely with standard techniques. Second, we prove that without the BQS model there is no 2–message zero-knowledge quantum interactive proof, even under computational assumptions.",

        "abstract": "An important goal in quantum key distribution (QKD) is the task of providing a finite-size security proof without the assumption of collective attacks. For prepare-and-measure QKD, one approach for obtaining such proofs is the generalized entropy accumulation theorem (GEAT), but thus far it has only been applied to study a small selection of protocols. In this work, we present techniques for applying the GEAT in finite-size analysis of generic prepare-and-measure protocols, with a focus on decoy-state protocols. In particular, we present an improved approach for computing entropy bounds for decoy-state protocols, which has the dual benefits of providing tighter bounds than previous approaches (even asymptotically) and being compatible with methods for computing min-tradeoff functions in the GEAT. Furthermore, we develop methods to incorporate some improvements to the finite-size terms in the GEAT, and implement techniques to automatically optimize the min-tradeoff function. Our approach also addresses some numerical stability challenges specific to prepare-and-measure protocols, which were not addressed in previous works.",

        "abstract": "Client authentication (CA) is a cryptographic protocol where a server tries to validate the identity of a client. Fehr et. al. proposed a CA protocol with pre-shared basis information between the client and server which has a nice key recycling property, where secrets including the pre-shared basis can be securely reused after each successful round. We extend the protocol to a practical setting by including decoy state and error correction, but the leakage of pre-shared basis information via multi-photon events limits the performance of such a protocol. As such, we propose the use of a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), assumed to be secure only during each run of the protocol, to perform basis selection to reduce information leakage. A formal proof of the protocol security is provided by modifying the entropic uncertainty relation to account for basis generated by a PRNG, which could be of independent interest as it may be applicable to other protocols such as quantum key distribution. An experimental implementation of the protocol, with appropriate post-selection, was performed to demonstrate its feasibility. We also designed a CA protocol secure in the practical setting with only two rounds of communication: a challenge by the server and a response by the client.",

We propose a general device independent quantum key distribution protocol for the subset of such non-local games that satisfy a monogamy-of-entanglement property characterised by a gap in the maximum winning probability between the bipartite and tripartite versions of the game. This gap is due to the optimal strategy for two players requiring entanglement, which due to its monogamy property cannot be shared with any additional players. Based solely on the monogamy-of-entanglement property, we provide a simple proof of information theoretic security of our protocol. Lastly, we numerically optimize the finite and asymptotic secret key rates of our protocol using the magic square game as an example, for which we provide a numerical bound on the maximal tripartite quantum winning probability which closely matches the bipartite classical winning probability.  Further, we show that our protocol is robust for depolarizing noise up to about $2.2%$, providing the first such bound for general attacks for magic square based quantum key distribution.",

        "abstract": "In prepare & measure continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems the quantum states generated by Alice and sent to Bob is typically performed using an optical fiber that connects both entities. However, the state of polarization (SOP) of the quantum signal transmitted in the optical fiber is inevitably disturbed due to random birefringence, impacting the overall secret key rate of the CV-QKD system. We study the secret key rate of a CV-QKD system considering the polarization drift occurring in the quantum channel. Channels with low polarization drift lightly impact the secret key rate of the system. This accounting for the SOP fluctuations. Moreover, we analyze the effect of the SOP fluctuations on the estimation of the channel transmission and of the excess noise when the polarization drift in the channel is disregarded. Such assumption results in a sub-estimation of the secret key rate, decreasing the performance of the system, when comparing with the theoretical value considering the polarization drift in the channel.",

        "abstract": "Typical security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) require that the emitted signals are independent and identically distributed. In practice, however, this assumption is not met because intrinsic device flaws inevitably introduce correlations between the emitted signals. Although analyses addressing this issue have been recently proposed, they only consider a restrictive scenario in which the correlations have a finite and known maximum length that is much smaller than the total number of emitted signals. While it is expected that the magnitude of the correlations decreases as the pulse separation increases, the assumption that this magnitude is exactly zero after a certain point does not seem to have any physical justification. Concerningly, this means that existing analyses cannot guarantee the security of current QKD implementations. Here, we solve this pressing problem by developing a general framework that can handle pulse correlations of unbounded length. Our framework allows us to directly use existing proofs addressing this imperfection without the need to construct them from scratch, thus reestablishing the security of QKD in a simple and versatile manner.",

        "abstract": "One of the most important requirements for the correct operation of the BB84 protocol is the preparation of the true random state. Most realizations follow this logic: Alice prepares random quantum states, measures them to extract random numbers, and then uses them to modulate the state of the transmitted light. The alternative approach is passive state preparation. It was proposed in 2010 and recently studied for security aspects. The idea is to use the natural phase randomness of the laser pulses to prepare random states. This approach can help to solve the security problem of correlating the state modulation voltage. Originally, the focus was on preparing the polarization state. This required two lasers or an additional intensity modulator. In this work, we use a laser that generates random phase pairs of subsequent pulses as a ready-to-use qubit. This allows us to simplify the Alice device. To perform a full phase characterization, we split a portion of the signal, convert it to polarization, and perform polarization tomography where we postselect four BB84 states. Without a decoy state, this QKD system is well suited for the last mile of a star quantum network with a loss budget of up to 10 dB. We have experimentally demonstrated passive state QKD over 10km deployed and spool fiber obtaining 10-100 bps of secret key correspondingly.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we study the post-quantum security of various threshold symmetric schemes. In a threshold scheme,  the secret-key is     split among multiple parties in order to protect the key.  Our first observation is  a security analysis in the superposition-access model might be needed for a multi-party threshold scheme in the post-quantum setting since a corrupt party may deliver its secret key to a quantum adversary. Consequently, the adversary can implement a partial evaluation of the multi-party threshold scheme on his quantum device and this can enforce a  superposition access to the underlying primitive. In other words, if the underlying  primitive is vulnerable to a superposition attack, then the security  of the  multi-party threshold scheme might break.    For instance, under a reasonable assumption we show that the NPR's threshold pseudorandom function (Naor et al. Eurocrypt 99) is not post-quantum secure if the underlying pseudorandom function family is not secure in the superposition-access model.",

While optical fibre communications are range-limited due to exponential losses in the absence of quantum memories and repeaters, satellites enable intercontinental quantum communications. However, the design of satellite quantum key distribution (SatQKD) systems has unique challenges over terrestrial networks. The typical approach to modelling SatQKD has been to estimate performances with a fully optimised protocol parameter space and with few payload and platform resource limitations. Here, we analyse how practical constraints affect the performance of SatQKD for the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) weak coherent pulse decoy state protocol with finite key size effects. We consider engineering limitations and trade-offs in mission design including limited in-orbit tunability, quantum random number generation rates and storage, and source intensity uncertainty. We quantify practical SatQKD performance limits to determine the long-term key generation capacity and provide performance benchmarks to support the design of upcoming missions",

        "abstract": "The security of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems is constantly being tested, and attacks that utilize probing pulses are have been widely developed recently. One of the most challenging methods is the Trojan-horse attack, which has been successfully demonstrated at 1924 nm. Moreover, the induced-photorefraction attack (IPA) represent attacks that will do better in the visible spectral range. We experimentally investigate the spectral properties of several conventional QKD components. We show that transmission of various fiber optical elements beyond telecommunication range  should be taken into account during QKD system design and development due to the possibility for attacks realization.",

However the realization of QKD in deployed networks, with high distances and/or complex network architecture is still a challenge. Trusted nodes is a known solution to these issues, but requires the delegation of trust to third parties. Here, we propose a trusted node protocol where the requirements of trust delegation are lowered, with no overhead in the consumption of the key exchanged with QKD, allowing to keep the same secret key rate. This protocol is then applied to 2 links in the Parisian Quantum Network, composed of dark dedicated fibers between 8 nodes in the Parisian region, for a total fiber distance of 57 km. Our results show the overall key exchange with no degradation of the key rate.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by the fact that coherent states may offer practical advantages it was recently shown that a continuous-variable (CV) quantum position verification (QPV) protocol using coherent states could be securely implemented if and only if attackers do not pre-share any entanglement. In the discrete-variable (DV) analogue of that protocol it was shown that modifying how the classical input information is sent from the verifiers to the prover leads to a favourable scaling in the resource requirements for a quantum attack. In this work, we show that similar conclusions can be drawn for CV-QPV. By adding extra classical information of size $n$ to a CV-QPV protocol, we show that the protocol, which uses a coherent state and classical information, remains secure, even if the quantum information travels arbitrarily slow, against attackers who pre-share CV (entangled) states with a linear (in $n$) cutoff at the photon number. We show that the protocol remains secure for certain attenuation and  excess noise.",

Along the lines of the NPA hierarchy, the optimal winning probability of those games can be upper bounded by a hierarchy of semidefinite programs (SDPs) converging to the optimal value. Here, we show that if one extends such games by considering constraints and loss, motivated by experimental errors and loss through quantum communication, the convergence of the SDPs to the optimal value still holds. We give applications of this result, and we compute SDPs that show tighter security for certain protocols in quantum cryptography such as relativistic bit commitment, quantum key distribution and quantum position verification.",

        "abstract": "Quantum correlations between measurements of two or more separated observers play a fundamental role in many applications, such as randomness generation or key distribution. Although security can be certified from correlations with minimal assumptions in the device-independent scenario, the performance of such protocols is currently limited.  This limitation motivates the exploration of sequential measurements, that is, defined with precise temporal ordering, as a means of improving performance through the reuse of the quantum states. To date, the study of sequential quantum protocols has been modest, lacking a comprehensive mathematical framework to explore the properties of the obtainable correlations.  In this study, we adopt a geometric perspective to investigate sequential quantum correlations, providing a general mathematical framework.  Here, we analytically prove a Tsirelson-like boundary for sequential quantum correlations, expressed as a trade-off between the amount of nonlocality shared by each sequential user. This boundary is particularly beneficial for the generation of secure quantum randomness. Indeed, observing a correlation on it can certify the maximum attainable bits per state in the case of one remote party and two sequential parties. In contrast to all previous schemes, this can happen even if one of the sequential users does not share any nonlocality.  We demonstrate that this quantum boundary can be reached with a simple qubit protocol and investigate numerically the robustness of randomness generation under realistic noise conditions, finding that it greatly improved compared to previous proposals.  Our proof-of-concept photonic implementation of the protocol confirms experimentally that our approach certifies more bits per state compared to the standard Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt scenario for the same noise, affirming both feasibility and robustness. This study marks a significant advance in understanding sequential quantum correlations, offering valuable insights and new mathematical tools for further fundamental studies and practical applications of efficient device-independent protocols.",

        "abstract": "Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) have obtained notable attention and undergone substantial development, driven by their utility across diverse fields including simulations, gambling, and cryptography. This surge in interest stems from their unique capacity to deliver inherent randomness, which can only be derived from the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. The key challenge lies in validating the quantum origin of the randomness produced, which usually requires either a thorough characterization of the elements in the setup or very experimentally challenging loophole-free bell tests. In this work, we present a simple, self-testing and cost-effective quantum random number generator (QRNG)  designed to operate with an untrusted measurement device and a partially characterized source, yielding a high rate of random bits. We consider a prepare-and-measure scenario where the preparation device takes a binary input x and a binary output b is received from the measurement device. Depending on the input, the preparation device sends either a weak coherent state (x=1) or a vacuum state (x=0). The measurement device employs homodyne detection to distinguish between these states, and the output value is chosen when the detector current is below (b=0) or above (b=1) a certain threshold. In order to certify the quantum origin of the randomness generated by output b, we need to track the correlations between input and output and the average energy per pulse must respect an upper bound. By using a continuous wave laser to seed the pulsed laser that generates the states, we avoid the need for expensive electro-optical modulators as used in https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08307. With this scheme we achieve an extraction rate of certified quantum randomness of around 625kHz.",

        "abstract": "Whilst the use of multi-partite entanglement is known to offer an advantage over bi-partite protocols in certain contexts, the quest to find practical advantage scenarios is ongoing and substantial difficulties in generalising some bi-partite security proofs remain. We present rigorous results that address both these challenges. First, we prove the security of a variant of the GHZ state based secret sharing protocol against general attacks, including participant attacks which break the security of the original GHZ state scheme. We then identify parameters for a performance advantage over realistic bottleneck networks in terms of extractable secret bits per network use. We show that whilst channel losses limit the advantage region to short distances over direct transmission networks, the addition of quantum repeaters unlocks the performance advantage of multi-partite entanglement over point-to-point approaches for long distance quantum cryptography.",

The payload is also equipped with a shot noise-limited homodyne detector, which will act as a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG), as well as a shot noise-limited optical receiver unit for ground-to-space uplink communication. We have also constructed an optical receiver unit for the ground station, based on single quadrature homodyne detection with shot noise sensitivity.

Operating under the assumption that entangled states with zero distillable key do not exist, we define the key cost of a quantum state, and device. We study its properties through the lens of a quantity that we call the key of formation. The main result of our paper is that the regularized key of formation is an upper bound on the key cost of a quantum state. The core protocol underlying this result is privacy dilution,  which converts states containing ideal privacy into ones with diluted privacy. Next, we show that the key cost is bounded from below by the regularized relative entropy of entanglement, which implies the irreversibility of the privacy creation-distillation process for a specific class of states. We further focus on mixed-state analogues of pure quantum states in the domain of privacy, and we prove that a number of entanglement measures are equal to each other for these states, similar to the case of pure entangled states. The privacy cost and distillable key in the single-shot regime exhibit a yield-cost relation, and basic consequences for quantum  devices are also provided.",

        "abstract": "Losses in the transmission channel, which increase with distance, pose a major obstacle to photonics demonstrations of quantum nonlocality and its applications to device-independent protocols such as device-independent quantum key distribution. Recently, Chaturvedi, Viola, and Pawlowski (CVP) arXiv:2211.14231 introduced a variation of standard Bell experiments, which we call routed Bell experiments, with the goal of extending the range over which quantum nonlocality can be demonstrated. In these experiments, in some of the rounds, photons from the source are routed by an actively controlled switch to a nearby test device instead of the distant one. CVP showed that there are quantum correlations in routed Bell experiments such that the outcomes of the remote device cannot be classically predetermined, even when its detection efficiency is arbitrarily low. In our work, we show that the correlations considered by CVP, though they cannot be classically predetermined, do not require the transmission of quantum systems to the remote device. This leads us to properly define the concept of 'short-range' and 'long-range' quantum correlations in routed Bell experiments. We then explore the conditions under which short-range quantum correlations can be ruled out. We find that routed Bell experiments do allow for reducing the detection efficiency threshold but the improvements are smaller than those suggested by CVP's analysis.  We then investigate DIQKD protocols based on the routed setup. We show how to analyze the security of these protocols and compute lower bounds on the key rates using non-commutative polynomial optimization and the Brown-Fawzi-Fawzi method. We determine lower bounds on the asymptotic key rates of several simple two-qubit routed DIQKD protocols based on CHSH or BB84 correlations and compare their performance to standard protocols. We find that in an ideal case routed DIQKD protocols can significantly improve detection efficiency requirements, by up to 30%, compared to their non-routed counterparts. Notably, the routed BB84 protocol achieves a positive key rate with a detection efficiency as low as 50% for the distant device, the minimal threshold for any DIQKD protocol featuring two untrusted measurements.  However, the advantages we find are highly sensitive to noise and losses affecting the short-range correlations involving the additional test device.",

        "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) technology allows sharing secret keys between two parties over an insecure channel. But there are vulnerabilities in the technical implementation of systems. Laser seeding attack is one of the examples of imperfections in QKD systems. Recent works have demonstrated that Eve can manipulate output power of Alice's laser. This leads to an increase of the average photon number, emitted by Alice. But this attack can be prevented by using passive fiber-optic elements such as isolators or DWDM-filters. In this work, we demonstrate a new kind of attack  namely, the optical pumping attack. This attack utilises imperfections in passive optic elements that are used in QKD systems to prevent other types of attack. Eve can use source at different wavelength to seed Alice laser, 1064 nm for example. This radiation would be absorbed by crystal within laser and create additional population inversion to inversion created by  bias current, that drives Alice laser. This pumping would change average photon number at the output of Alice, leading to wrong estimation of lower  bound on the secret key rate. This creates a side-channel for Eve for obtaining key information. In this work we performed this kind of attack for several wavelengths: 1064 nm, 1310 nm, 1480 nm and 2000 nm, measured changing of pulse energy, average output power and pulse shape under attacks at different wavelengths. Finally, we provide theoretical estimation of required isolation at the tested wavelengths to protect the source against the optical-pumping attack.",

        "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) has emerged as a leading solution to meet the increasing need for secure communication systems in the light of potential threads posed by advancements in quantum computing. Recent developments include multiple works on high-dimensional QKD systems, which outperform qubit-based solutions in terms of ro- bustness and theoretically-achievable key rates. However, such systems are more compli- cated and expensive. In this work we overcome those issues by using only one single photon detector per measurement basis. We show that high-dimensional QKD symbols can be de- tected using a single time-resolved photon detector with the Talbot effect. We report on the theoretical limitations of our method and present experimentally-obtained key rates for the two-dimensional and four-dimensional case.",

        "abstract": "Variational techniques have been recently developed to find incredibly tight bounds on the von Neumann entropy in a completely device-independent (DI) setting. This, in turn, has led to significantly improved key rates of DI protocols, in both the asymptotic limit as well as in the finite-size regime. In this paper, we discuss two approaches towards applying these variational methods for Petz-Rényi divergences instead. We then show how this can be used to further improve the finite-size key rate of DI protocols, utilizing a fully-Rényi entropy accumulation theorem developed in a partner work. Petz-Rényi divergences can also be applied to study DI advantage distillation, in which two-way communication is used to improve the noise tolerance of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. We implement these techniques to derive increased noise tolerances for DIQKD protocols, which surpass all previous known bounds.",

Ourplatform allows us to perform an analysis for quantum repeater setups and strategies that go far beyondknown analytical results: This refers to being able to both capture more realistic noise models and analyzemore complex repeater strategies. We present a number of findings centered around the combination ofstrategies for improving performance, such as entanglement purification and the use of multiple repeaterstations, and demonstrate that there exist complex relationships between them.

        "abstract": "The successful application of Quantum Key Distribution is dependent on the accurate generation and detection of quantum states, and a communication mechanism that can withstand disturbances caused in the channel. The selection of the optimal encoding strategy is complex and is influenced by external elements such as the characteristics of the quantum channel. Polarization encoding is acknowledged for its dependability and low error rate, rendering it ideal for free-space links, whereas time-bin encoding is robust to birefringence, thereby making it suitable for optical fiber networks. The strength of polarization-based protocols is based on the full characterization of the receiver, to reconstruct the information encoded in the shared qubits. This is typically achieved through tomographic analysis, which adds to the complexity of the final protocol. In this research, we introduce a unique cross-encoded method, where high precision quantum states are produced using a self-regulating, calibration-free polarization modulator and then conveyed through a polarization-to-time-bin converter. A hybrid receiver is used to carry out both time-of-arrival and polarization measurements for decoding the quantum states. Moreover, the suggested receiver is optimized to perform a self-characterization process, utilizing the same photons in which the information is encoded. The adaptability of our approach can lead to a significant advancement in the creation of hybrid networks that incorporate both optical fiber and free-space networks.",

        "abstract": "In satellite-based quantum key distribution (QKD), the number of secret bits that can be generated in a single satellite pass over the ground station is severely restricted by the pass duration and the free-space optical channel loss. High channel loss may decrease the signal-to-noise ratio due to background noise, reduce the number of generated raw key bits, and increase the quantum bit error rate (QBER), all of which have detrimental effects on the output secret key length. Under finite-size security analysis, higher QBER increases the minimum raw key length necessary for non-zero secret key length extraction due to less efficient reconciliation and post-processing overheads. We show that recent developments in finite key analysis allow three different small-satellite-based QKD projects CQT-Sat, UK-QUARC-ROKS, and QEYSSat to produce secret keys even under very high loss conditions, improving on estimates based on previous finite key bounds. This suggests that satellites in low Earth orbit can satisfy finite-size security requirements, but remains challenging for satellites further from Earth. We analyse the performance of each mission to provide an informed route toward improving the performance of small-satellite QKD missions. We highlight the short and long-term perspectives on the challenges and potential future developments in small-satellite-based QKD and quantum networks. In particular, we discuss some of the experimental and theoretical bottlenecks, and improvements necessary to achieve QKD and wider quantum networking capabilities in daylight and at different altitudes.",

The size, weight, and power (SWaP) restrictions of these platforms pose constraints that potentially impact the system performance of mobile nodes. Here, we will discuss our progress towards developing a low-SWaP mobile quantum key distribution (QKD) platform that can exchange quantum-secured random keys between both drones and cars. We implement a finite-key security proof that incorporates system imperfections in state preparation and analysis, including channel losses. These imperfections, present in any system, require consideration during key consolidation to minimize information leakage. We demonstrate average finite secure key rates between mobile platforms up to 19.6 kbit/s.",

In this work, we develop a protocol for verifying that two parties located at specified positions share an entangled quantum state. We accomplish this by embedding the CHSH game in a quantum position verification protocol. This provides a form of entanglement testing that not only ensures that provers passing the protocol share entanglement, but that they are also located where they claim to be. This prevents parties from passing the verification test by simply forwarding the input of the verification protocol to other parties that share entanglement. The protocol has low requirements on the quantum computational abilities of honest provers---namely, it only requires the honest provers to manipulate two qubits each. It achieves security against adversaries located at incorrect positions that share at most a logarithmic amount of quantum memory with respect to the size of the classical input.",

        "abstract": "It is well-known that digital signatures can be constructed from one-way functions in a black-box way. While one-way functions are essentially the minimal assumption in classical cryptography, this is not the case in the quantum setting. A variety of qualitatively weaker and inherently quantum assumptions (e.g. EFI pairs, one-way state generators, and pseudorandom states) are known to be sufficient for non-trivial quantum cryptography. While it is known that commitments, zero-knowledge proofs, and even multiparty computation can be constructed from these assumptions, it has remained an open question whether the same is true for quantum digital signatures schemes (QDS). In this work, we show that there does not exist a black-box construction of a QDS scheme with classical signatures from pseudorandom states with linear, or greater, output length. Our result complements that of Morimae and Yamakawa (2022), who described a one-time secure QDS scheme with classical signatures, but left open the question of constructing a standard multi-time secure one.",

The network has dual-functionality : during the satellite-pass the network adopts a point-to-multipoint topology where all the users communicate with the satellite in an uplink configuration. Outside of a satellite pass, the signal is rerouted through telecom fibre to form a fully-connected network on the ground. To minimize the hardware requirements, we consider a multiplexed pulsed entangled photon source combined with a frequency-to-time mapping. We evaluate the potential of the proposed network configuration by simulating its performance for different quantum key distribution scenarios. Our results show that high key rates can be achieved in spite of limited resources on the satellite. An experimental verification of the protocol is under way, and we will present the latest findings. The promising scalability and easy integration make this network architecture a good candidate for future quantum communication networks.",

However, the loophole issues hamper the practical applications.      We report the first demonstration of steering nonlocality with detection loophole closed at telecommunication wavelengths.      In this endeavour, we design and fabricate a low-loss silicon chip for efficient entanglement generation, and further apply direct modulation technique to its optical pump to eliminate phase-encoding loss at the steering side.      The newly proposed phase-encoding measurement setting adapts to an ultra fast modulation rate (GHz).

Our setup provides an immediate platform for exploring applications based on steering nonlocality, especially for quantum communication.",

Our research introduces a layer of quantum security to this standard process, specifically designed for free-space channels. We explore a hybrid communication method that simultaneously handles classical information in the traditional manner and quantum information through fluctuations in a sub-Poissonian noise-floor. Our approach utilizes a continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV QKD) protocol, employing a Gaussian ensemble of squeezed states combined with direct detection. This allows for the generation of secure keys while maintaining classical communication, under passive attacks. This quantum-enhanced method offers simplicity, robustness, and efficiency without compromising classical data transfer rates. We have conducted detailed simulations to evaluate the protocol's performance in a free-space atmospheric channel and assessed the security of the CV QKD protocol in the composable finite-size scenario. This added quantum layer provides a practical, secure enhancement to standard laser communication systems.",

More precisely, we consider a quantity we call the maximal intrinsic Rényi randomness and combine it with recent results on privacy amplification to derive simple expressions for the maximal quantity of $\\epsilon$-secure randomness that can be extracted from finite uses of some memoryless source (which may be entangled with some eavesdropper). Overall this gives a simple method to compute this operationally relevant quantity and provides a benchmarking tool for the rates of finite size security proofs for randomness generation and quantum key distribution protocols.

        "abstract": "Since the first QKD protocol was proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984, practical QKD systems have been successfully demonstrated. Despite these developments, QKD systems have not been widely deployed due to imperfections in real-world devices. Many eavesdropping methods have been proposed to exploit the imperfections. One of those is the time-shift attack that exploits mismatches in temporal responses of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) to control the receiver’s detection. Zhao’s group demonstrated the time-shift attack successfully in 2008. The time-shift attack can be realized with current technology, and it will threaten the secure key distribution. We propose a simple and effective countermeasure to the time-shift attack by connecting additional APDs to detection ports through beamsplitters to average temporal responses of APDs. This method can reduce the photon detection mismatches between port 0 and port 1. Our simulation shows that averaging the temporal responses of APDs efficiently neutralizes the attack.",

        "abstract": "Continuous variable encoding of quantum information requires the deterministic generation of highly correlated quantum states of light in the form of quantum networks, which, in turn, necessitates the controlled generation of a large number of squeezed modes. In this work, we present an experimental source of multimode squeezed states of light at telecommunication wavelengths. Generation at such wavelengths is especially important as it can enable quantum information processing, communication, and sensing beyond the laboratory scale. We use a single-pass spontaneous parametric down-conversion process in a non-linear waveguide pumped with the second harmonic of a femtosecond laser. We demonstrate multiparty entanglement by measuring the state’s covariance matrix. Our measurements reveal significant squeezing in more than 21 frequency modes, with a maximum squeezing value exceeding 2.5 dB. We finally present a frequency-multiplexed quantum key distribution protocol and the expected key rates in bipartite and in multipartite scenarii.",

We assume there is no long-term quantum memory, that is, after a finite time interval, referred to as extbf DELAY, the states stored in the devices decohere. By robustness, which is a highlight of our protocols, we mean that the protocols are correct and secure even when devices are slightly off from their ideal specifications (the \\emph{faulty but non-malicious} regime). This is an important property, since in the real world, devices would certainly have small manufacturing errors and cannot be expected to be ideal. To the best of our understanding and  knowledge, none of the known DI protocols for OT and BC in the literature are robust; they can not guarantee correctness in the faulty but non-malicious regime. Our protocols are sequentially composable and hence, can be used as building blocks to construct larger protocols, while still preserving security guarantees.",

        "abstract": "Linear-optical entanglement swapping works only probabilistically. Quantum repeater protocols based on it, classified in the first generation, inevitably need classical communication between non-adjacent nodes, which makes the protocols very slow and requires quantum memories with long coherence time. One way to realize faster quantum repeater protocols, classified in the second generation, is to use matter qubits, which enables deterministic entanglement swapping. However, such matter qubits are still experimentally challenging. Here we propose a linear-optical circuit that projects two input qudits of dimension d onto a Bell state defined in a two-qubit subspace with the probability of 1 − d−1, which can be used to realize almost deterministic entanglement swapping for large d. Based on it, we propose a quantum repeater protocol consisting of linear optical elements, photon detectors, high-dimensional quantum memories, and photonic three-qudit GHZ states. In the protocol, the classical communication between non-adjacent nodes becomes unnecessary thanks to the high success probability of the entanglement swapping, making the protocol be categorized into the second generation.",

        "abstract": "In a quantum key distribution protocol, an eavesdropper Eve extracts information by performing the measurement on flying qubits. If the measurement basis does not match with the basis in which the qubit is prepared, it leads to a disturbance in the qubit state with 1/2 probability. There is an optimal condition between Information Gain and tolerable disturbance. Leveraging machine learning techniques, several advances have been made in the rapid development of quantum applications. In order to achieve the (upper) bound for Information Gain vs. disturbance trade-off, we investigate this optimal condition for the BB84 protocol using the gradient descent algorithm. By employing such a numerical method, we report an improvisation in the upper bound of the disturbance compare to the existing best threshold reported in Phys. Rev. A, 56 1163 (1997). Interestingly, the Information Gain by Eve at this bound is relatively less than reported in the above paper. It means with our strategy Alice-Bob are in advantageous position in both ways as they do not have to abort the protocol as early as required in Phys. Rev. A, 56 1163 (1997) at d=0.146447, as well as now the information leaked to Eve is also lowered.",

The noise in such states unavoidably emerges due to optical losses in the state preparation and has to be taken into account in any practical scenario, with the outcomes depending on the trust assumption on such noise. We show that the untrusted noise should pessimistically be allocated to the anti-squeezed (AS) quadrature and can break the security of the protocols already in the asymptotic regime. In the finite-size regime we analyze the impact of the AS noise on the parameter estimation, showing that it limits the performance of the protocols even if assumed trusted and requires the protocol modifications in terms of modulation and detection schemes. We also consider the noisy squeezed-state CV QKD in the channels with transmittance fluctuations (typical for the atmospheric channels) and show that even trusted AS noise can break the security of the protocols in this regime due to fluctuations-related channel excess noise, which has to be assumed untrusted. Our results demonstrate the importance of the squeezing purity in practical realizations of squeezed-state CV QKD.",

        "abstract": "High-quality, distributed quantum entanglement is the distinctive resource for quantum communication and forms the foundation for the unequalled level of security that can be assured in quantum key distribution. While the entanglement provider does not need to be trusted, the secure key rate drops to zero if the entanglement used is too noisy. In this work, we show experimentally that QPA is able to increase the secure key rate achievable with QKD by improving the quality of distributed entanglement, thus increasing the quantum advantage in QKD. Beyond that, we show that QPA enables key generation at noise levels that previously prevented key generation. We provide a detailed characterisation of the gain in secure key rate achieved in our proof-of-principle experiment at different noise levels. The use of hyperentanglement in the field-tested polarisation and energy-time degrees of freedom enhances the efficiency of our scheme, making it an attractive option for deployment in high-loss regimes.",

        "abstract": "A crucial assumption in most quantum key distribution (QKD) security proofs, is that no information about the selected settings is leaked to the channel. A secure space around the users' devices is usually required to ensure both parties can generate and handle classical data securely. However, this condition is not feasible in practice, since the devices usually leak some information passively, and an eavesdropper could even run a Trojan horse attack (THA) by injecting bright light into the QKD apparatuses, causing an active leak of information. In this paper, we present the first security proof for a decoy state protocol that considers an arbitrary leakage from every setting selected in the source due to passive or active information leakage. Furthermore, we apply our security proof to various cases of practical interest and we analyze the effectiveness of placing an extra phase modulator in the source to improve the secret key rate. Our analysis is also experimentally friendly, as it only requires one parameter to encapsulates all side-channel imperfections. We believe that our results constitute a vital step in closing the existing gap between theory and implementation in QKD.",

Instead of relying on complete state tomography, our method measures select elements of the density matrix and completes the remaining elements through convex optimization to minimize the entanglement measure. This allows us to compute a lower bound for the Schmidt number and the entanglement of formation, providing a practical alternative to traditional techniques. Our approach is flexible and does not require measurements in specific bases, making it particularly advantageous for time-bin entanglement scenarios.",

It has been shown, however, that perfectly secure oblivious transfer is impossible in both the classical and quantum setting. This has pushed the study of oblivious transfer in two directions. The first is applying assumptions about the abilities of a cheating party such as in the bounded storage model. The second is looking for the absolute bounds on a cheating party with no restrictions. We study the latter area, using one version of oblivious transfer known as Rabin oblivious transfer. This is a two-party protocol where the sender holds one bit, and the receiver obtains this bit with a set probability.",

        "abstract": "One of the most significant vulnerabilities in the source unit of quantum key distribution~(QKD) is the correlation between quantum states after modulation, which shall be characterized and evaluated for its practical security performance. In this work, we propose a methodology to characterize the intensity correlation according to the single-photon detection results in the measurement unit without modifying the configuration of the QKD system. In contrast to the previous research that employs extra classical optical detector to measure the correlation, our method can directly analyse the detection data generated during the raw key exchange, enabling to characterize the feature of correlation in real-time system operation. The basic method is applied to a BB84 QKD system and the characterized correlation significantly decreases the secure key rate shown by the security proof. Furthermore, the method is extended and applied to characterize the correlation from the result of Bell-state measurement, which demonstrates its applicability to a running full-scheme MDI QKD system. This study provides an approach for standard certification of a QKD system.",

        "abstract": "The advancement of quantum computing presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant threats to contemporary cryptographic systems. This research explores the potential of quantum algorithms, specifically Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm, in decrypting widely used cryptographic standards, including AES, Triple DES, RSA, and ECC, which are integral to the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-3. Shor's algorithm, known for its polynomial-time factorization capabilities, poses a direct threat to RSA and ECC by efficiently solving the underlying mathematical problems that ensure their security. Meanwhile, Grover's algorithm, which offers quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, can effectively reduce the security margins of symmetric key algorithms such as AES and Triple DES. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the vulnerabilities exposed by these quantum algorithms, evaluates the current cryptographic landscape, and discusses the implications for information security. Additionally, we explore potential quantum-resistant cryptographic approaches to mitigate these threats, ensuring robust security in the advent of practical quantum computing.",

However, designing an entanglement routing scheme, which achieves the maximized network connections and the optimal overall network efficiency simultaneously, remains a huge challenge for quantum networks.

The evaluation results show that the proposed DSER scheme can be performed for constructing various large scale quantum networks.",

In traditional multireceiver quantum digital signature schemes without an arbitrater, the transferability of one-to-one signature is always required to achieve unforgeability, with complicated implementation and heavy key consumption. In this article, we propose an arbitrated quantum digital signature scheme, in which the signature can be verified by multiple receivers simultaneously, and meanwhile, the transferability of the signature is still kept. Our scheme can be simplified performed to various quantum secure networks, due to the proposed efficient signature calculation procedure with low secure key consumption and low computation complexity, by employing one-time universal hashing algorithm and one-time pad encryption scheme. The evaluation results show that our scheme uses at least two orders of magnitude less key than existing signature schemes with transferability when signing files of the same length with the same number of receivers and security parameter settings.",

Deterministic methods of producing random numbers cannot guarantee true randomness due to their susceptibility to external perturbations and deterministic origins. Quantum mechanics due to its probabilistic nature can be used to generate random numbers that cannot be predicted. Here we describe the design of a compact, inexpensive, and manufacturable QRNG based on balanced detection of shot noise from an LED in a commercially available off-the-shelf package which can be integrated into existing devices.",

        "abstract": "Time-bin encoding is more favorable in fiber-based implementation of quantum key distribution (QKD) than polarization encoding as it avoids issues inherent for polarization encoding, such as birefringence, caused by optical fibers. QKD only with passive devices is desirable to prevent side-channel attacks possible in the case of use of active devices such as modulators. The Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol is a strong candidate for an implementation with satisfying these; it can be implemented using time bins with a passive delayed interferometer that inevitably generates \"satellite time bins\", two pulses outside the phase-interference timing. Although time-bin encoding BB84 has been frequently demonstrated, there is no consensus whether satellite time bins can be used to extract a key. Besides, there is no security proof for either case. Here, we prove the security of time-bin encoding BB84 protocol with a passive delayed interferometer and threshold detectors. If satellite time bins are used for key generation, we show that an additional operation is necessary for security. The result is not limited only to BB84 but can be applied to Bennett-Brassard-Mermin 1992 and quantum conference key agreement based on time bins.",

        "title": "Study of High-intensity entangled photon-pair source towards  high-loss regime",
        "abstract": "In 1995, a research team including P. G. Kwiat developed high-intensity entangled photon pair  sources. In 2000, C. Simon and D. Bouwmeester theoretically studied the multi-photon effects of  entangled photon pairs. Such research provides valuable tools for designing and analyzing longdistance entanglement distribution experiments in high-loss regime or satellite-to-ground QKD systems,  which require high-intensity entangled photon pair sources. In this study, unlike previous papers that analyzed only specific scenarios, we numerically  presented measurement results achievable through analysis in general scenarios. Based on these  measured probability values, we confirmed that the results of state tomography. To prepare entangled photon pair sources, the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC)  phenomenon is commonly utilized. A notable characteristic of this SPDC phenomenon is that as the  intensity of the incident pump beam increases, the quantum state tends to take the form of a two-mode  squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state. In this scenario, where photons corresponding to each arm of the  quantum state, namely the idler and signal photons, are distributed to Alice and Bob, respectively, the  quantum state undergoing loss channels can be analyzed in the beam splitter scheme. Leveraging this fact, we analytically calculated the probability values of measurement outcomes in  a general scenario where Alice and Bob each have different loss channels and measurement bases are  determined by their choices. Here, we assumed that both of Alice and Bob employ systems utilizing  two threshold detectors for photon measurements. Analyzing the computed measurement outcomes reveals that the resulting state always takes the form  of the Werner state, regardless of factors such as the intensity of the entangled photon pair source,  channel losses, and the relative measurement basis angles of Alice and Bob. This suggests that even in  long-distance entanglement distribution experiments in high-loss regime, the optimization and  preservation of measurement bases using twirling techniques can be applied effectively, even when  using high-intensity entangled photon pair sources.",

However, it has the drawback that the finite-size bounds it yields are not necessarily optimal, and furthermore, it relies on the construction of an affine min-tradeoff function, which in practice can often be challenging to construct optimally. In this work, we address both of these challenges simultaneously by deriving a new entropy-accumulation bound. Our bound yields significantly better finite-size performance, and can be computed as a convex optimization without any specification of affine min-tradeoff functions. Furthermore, it can be applied directly at the level of Rényi entropies if desired, yielding fully-Rényi security proofs. Our proof techniques are based on elaborating on a connection between entropy accumulation and the framework of quantum probability estimation, and in the process we obtain some new results with respect to the latter framework as well.",

        "title": "Towards the certification of quantum key distribution systems",
        "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) is at the verge of becoming a commercially viable security solution, backed by mathematically formulated security proofs. In the last two decades, much effort has been devoted to closing the gap between the models and practical implementations in order to account for device imperfections and counter the resulting side-channel attacks. As a result, the topic of evaluating and certifying QKD systems against these attacks is increasingly coming to the forefront. This last step however presents its own challenges, currently hindering the widespread adoption of QKD. In this work, we lay at the intersection between theory and practice, focusing on the process of preparing an in-house QKD system for evaluation. We first present a consolidated and accessible security proof for the one-decoy and two-decoy state BB84 protocols, which serves as a baseline for our QKD system. Building on this security proof, we identify the critical side-channels by evaluating the risk of most of today's known attacks. We then tackle the most critical attacks by discussing existing countermeasures that can be implemented both in the QKD system and within the security proof, where applicable. In this process, we develop new methods to characterize and evaluate QKD systems, which can later be used in evaluation laboratories. Evaluating the security of QKD systems additionally involves performing attacks to potentially identify new loopholes. Thus, we also aim to perform the first real-time Trojan horse attack on a decoy state BB84 system, further highlighting the need for robust countermeasures. By providing a critical evaluation of our QKD system and incorporating robust countermeasures against side-channel attacks, our research contributes to advancing the practical implementation and evaluation of QKD as a trusted security solution.",

        "abstract": "Silicon avalanche photodiode (APD) single-photon detectors in space are continuously affected by radiation, which gradually degrades their dark count performance. From August 2016 to June 2023, we conducted approximately seven years (2507 days) of in-orbit monitoring of the dark count performance of APD single-photon detectors on the Micius Quantum Science Experimental Satellite. The results showed that due to radiation effects, the dark count growth rate was approximately 6.79 cps/day @ -24 °C and 0.37 cps/day @ -55 °C, with a significant suppression effect on radiation-induced dark counts at lower operating temperature. Based on the proposed radiation damage induced dark count annealing model, simulations were conducted for the in-orbit dark counts of the detector, the simulation results are consistent with in-orbit test data. In May 2022, four of these detectors underwent a cumulative 5.7 hours high-temperature annealing test at 76 °C, dark count rate shows no measurable changes, consistent with annealing model. As of now, these ten APD single-photon detectors on the Micius Quantum Science Experimental Satellite have been in operation for approximately 2507 days and are still functioning properly, providing valuable experience for the future long-term space applications of silicon APD single-photon detectors.",

        "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) systems’ performance is highly affected by losses and background noise, decreasing the secure bit rate in long-distance and/or high noise links. This is one of the limitations of this technology, implying long times for sharing cryptographic keys. One of the solutions for this problem consists in simply sending more pulses in less time, that is to say, increasing the bit rate. However, this solution has a problem when it comes to discrete variable QKD systems using single photon detectors, especially with semiconductor Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs). Commercially available SPADs introduce high temporal jitter to the measurements, increasing the probability of inter-symbol interference. Temporal jitter can produce measurements of a bit in the temporal window of previous or next bits, which may generate measurement errors increasing the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER). This means that we achieve higher bit rates but we may also increase QBER, decreasing secure bit rate, imposing a limit in the bit rate. In this work, we model the effect of temporal jitter on the QBER, validate the model with actual measurements, and use the model to study the effect of temporal jitter on high-speed QKD systems. In the case of commercial SPADs, with standard deviation values for the temporal jitter near 150 ps, the optimum bit rate is about few GHz. In order to operate at higher speeds we need single photon detectors with less jitter, what we can achieve with superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD).",

        "abstract": "Quantum data centres (QDCs) are a promising way of scaling up quantum computers. In a single-processor quantum computer, the number of high-quality computational qubits is limited by cross talk and difficulties in addressing individual qubits when many qubits share the same housing. QDCs circumvent these challenges by linking together multiple small quantum processing units (QPUs) over short distances. With this architecture, the intra-QPU noise is kept small, but additional noise is introduced due to the latency of and imperfections in the inter-QPU links. Understanding the trade-offs between these different types of noise is essential for guiding future efforts in QDC manufacture and compilation. We develop and use a classical simulator to emulate the execution of different quantum circuits on an imperfect QDC. An individual inter-QPU CNOT gate is first-considered and then a selection of larger circuits are investigated. In both cases, we implement inter-QPU gates using cat-comm and three variants of TP-comm, which we call 1TP-comm, 2TP-comm and TP-safe, respectively. We find that 1TP-comm and cat-comm yield different output fidelities despite both schemes having the same number of gates, measurements and inter-QPU entanglements. We also determine the relative impacts of entanglement error, intra-QPU gate error and memory depolarisation.",

        "abstract": "The post-processing process is an indispensable part of the continuous variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD), which converts partially relevant and partially secure measurement data to a completely consistent and information-theoretic secure key. Among them, parameter estimation is an important means of evaluating system parameters, and provides parameter basis for subsequent key extraction processes. However, the existed methods usually divide the free space into several relatively stable subchannels and use sampling estimation to achieve parameter estimation, which are limited by the quality and quantity of statistical samples. Here, we firstly propose a free-space parameter estimation scheme based on Bayesian estimation. Experiment has been proven that Bayesian schemes has advantages in estimation accuracy and stability compared to sampling statistical schemes, and has good performance in both free space and fiber channels, with high robustness and accuracy. Moreover, key reconciliation is also a highly anticipated aspect of CVQKD post-processing. But when the signal-to-noise ratio of the quantum channel changes, constant-bit-rate correction codes lead to a decrease in reconciliation efficiency, further deteriorating the system performance. We further propose a rate-adaptive Polar code reconciliation scheme and a scheme based on intermediate channel low-density parity check code cascaded polar code (IC-LDPC Polar code) to improve reconciliation efficiency and cope with practical long-distance CVQKD systems.",

        "abstract": "Numerous imperfections of realistic setup elements required for the implementation of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols impose strong limitation on their performance, particularly in terms of the obtainable key generation rate. A possible way to increase this quantity in the case of utilizing spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) source, producing strongly correlated pairs of photons, is to use wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) modules in order to direct photons of different wavelengths into separate detection systems utilized by the trusted parties. In this way it can be possible to generate multiple cryptographic keys in paralell, significantly increasing the overall key rate. In this work we theoretically investigate the potential improvement offered by such possibility in the case of entanglement-based version of the BB84 protocol realized with pulsed-pump SPDC source. We optimize the properties of the produced photon pairs and the intensity of the utilized pumping laser in order to maximize the potential improvement over the traditional, non-WDM, setup configuration.  We consider  both noiseless case, with ideal single-photon detectors utilized by the trusted parties and more practical situation with imperfect binary detectors, in which case we develop formulas for optimizing the detection window when the temporal filtering method is used to reduce the quantum bit error rate.",

In contrast to the widely used approach, where losses and thermal broadening are introduced through a beamsplitter transformation,   our analysis  uses the exactly solvable quantum channel model   describing the Lindblad dynamics of multimode bosonic systems   interacting with a heat bath and additionally takes into account imperfections of the homodyne   detection scheme.  The analytical results for the photon count difference and the quadrature  probability distributions are used to derive the expression for  the mutual information between legitimate parties, which explicitly links the information properties of CV QKD and the parameters of the channel. For the important special case of a two-mode photonic system propagating in a fiber channel, the latter can be conveniently parameterized using the frequency and the relaxation rate vectors that characterize the coherent (dynamical) intermode couplings and the incoherent (environment mediated) interaction between the bosonic modes, respectively. It turned out that these vectors determine four qualitatively different dynamical regimes of the mutual information and the phase difference between the signal and the local oscillator that may significantly affect the operation of CV QKD.",

        "abstract": "Entanglement is a unique and invaluable resource for quantum information processing because it highlights the non-locality property, which allows for device-independent (DI) quantum communication protocols, such as Quantum Key Distribution and Quantum Random Number Generation. However, the distribution of entanglement over long distances is challenging due to propagation losses and instability. Time-bin entanglement is a promising solution since it is robust in long-distance distribution over fiber optics and immune to the polarization distortion such a channel can introduce. Time-bin has also been demonstrated to be compatible with NV center-based quantum technologies, representing a crucial interface between the different devices in quantum networks. Nevertheless, its most common implementation suffers from a post-selection loophole (PSL), which invalidates Bell non-locality tests and renders it vulnerable to quantum hacking attacks, thus preventing its use for device-independent protocols. We present a scheme using optical switches to obtain only detection events displaying non-local interference, thereby closing the PSL. Our scheme works with 1550nm biphotons for entanglement distribution over existing fiber-based telecom networks. The switches show a high extinction ratio of up to 30dB and stability over extended periods. We also measure interferometric visibilities of over 94%, which corresponds to a CHSH S parameter of 2.65",

However, not all QKD setups fulfill the ideal model requirements, since imperfections in real devices have been proved to make the secret exchange vulnerable to certain attacks. These types of vulnerabilities are overcome by new Measurement Device Independent (MDI) QKD protocols, which protect the security against detector side-channel attacks and enable secure communication over longer distances. As such, the MDI-QKD protocol involves a third-party relay (Charlie) who might be under the control of an eavesdropper and to which Alice and Bob send their states for the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect to take place. The Hong-Ou-Mandel effect is a quantum interference phenomenon between two indistinguishable photons at a beam splitter that bears significant weight within the context of Bell state measurements and is crucial for the security of MDI-QKD and its realistic implementation. In this work, we put together an experimental setup to observe and monitor the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. By synchronizing two indistinguishable weak coherent pulses (WCP) to arrive simultaneously at a 50:50 beam splitter (following (2)), it has been possible to verify that the two photons exit together through the same output only if the quantum interference takes place. Consequently, detection event occurs at just one detector. The most significant experimental evidence of such effect is the Hong-Ou-Mandel dip (3), a plot representing the number of coincidence detections against the temporal delay induced in one of the pulses. It should be noted that, since we are using WCPs instead of photon number states, the interference contrast is 50%. We successfully attested to the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect by obtaining a clear and pronounced dip. To enhance its visibility, we varied and tested several experimental components. These results thus obtained, along with the discussion of the experimental techniques relevant to test such a phenomenon, provide valuable insights for future advancements in quantum interference studies in the context of quantum communications.

        "title": "Hierarchical Quantum Secret Sharing for Multi-Node Satellite Communication Network using the Qline Architecture",
        "abstract": "We propose to design a hierarchical quantum secret sharing (HQSS) for multi-node satellite communication network, leveraging the Qline architecture (1), represents unique topology that features a linear quantum network configuration, where qubit generation and measurement occur at the endpoint satellites, with intermediate satellite nodes are limited to single-qubit unitary transforms. In designing a HQSS for multi-node satellite communication network, we consider a group of at least four satellites (A, B, C, D), in linear quantum network configuration, where qubit generation and measurement occur at the endpoint Satellites A and D respectively, with two intermediate satellites B and C limited to single-qubit measurement and unitary transforms. This setting will restrict the two intermediate satellites B and C to allow using lower powers needing the cooperation from the endpoint Satellites A and D, however, endpoint Satellite D utilizes the higher powers to reconstruct the secret without the measurement outcome of one of the lower power intermediate Satellite B or C. The hierarchical structure depends on the trusted (end node Satellite D) or untrusted (intermediate Satellite B, C) locations within a satellite quantum network. Our motivation is to use this hierarchical power for long-distance QSS, allowing leading Satellite A to securely share a quantum secret to Satellite D while bypassing one of the intermediate satellites B or C. Satellite A utlizes a 4-qubit cluster quantum entangled state with Satellites B, C, and D to perform HQSS in Qline architecture. The simplicity of hardware at intermediate nodes in the Qline architecture facilitates easier implementation of proposed HQSS for multi-node satellites. Our HQSS based on Q-line configuration shows that hierarchy (2) with minimal hardware (1, 3) would be the standard requirements in future terrestrial and non-terrestrial quantum networks (2, 3). Further, we also explore the links of our proposed HQSS protocol to semi-quantum (classical) regime (3) operated by intermediate satellite nodes. Moreover, unlike traditional QKD networks, our design based on Qline architecture doesn't require key routing through intermediate nodes, enhancing security by avoiding exposure to these nodes, without consuming established keys for routing security. Rather established keys can be efficiently consumed by a leading Satellite A to securely distributed the entanglement among intermediate Satellites B, C and endpoint Satellite D nodes. As the security of key establishment on Qline networks is composable (1), ensuring that established keys can be utilized for secure entanglement distribution executed by Satellite A among inter-satellite quantum communication network, thereby advancing larger constellations securely.

Further, we investigate our proposed OSB MDI-QSDC in the noisy environment and compare it with conjugate coding MDI-QSDC. We aim for achieving superior performance of OSB protocols than conjugate-coding based protocols under certain noisy environment, supported with the existing study of best basis choice of decoy qubits required for secure quantum communication. Furthermore, we have analyzed the security of the proposed protocols under several attacks such as intercept-and-resend attack, entangle-and-measure attack, fake entangled particles attack and flip attack. We show that with some modifications, the proposed OSB MDI-QSDC protocols can also be reduced to OSB MDI versions of QKD protocols.",

        "title": "Security against coherent attacks in discrete-modulated continuous-variable quantum key distribution",
        "abstract": "Discrete-Modulated Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (DMCVQKD) protocols are amenable for deployment in quantum communication networks due to their experimental simplicity, but pose theoretical challenges impeding their tight security analyses. Major progress has recently been made in the finite-size regime against independent and identical (iid) collective attacks (Kanitschar, F. et. al., (2023), PRX Quantum, 4(4), p.040306). However, a complete and rigorous analysis must take into account correlated rounds of attack beyond the iid-collective assumption, and must not assume a photon-number cutoff on the signal states. The difficulty of achieving this lies in the absence of an information-theoretic framework for proving security that handles infinite dimensional multipartite quantum states that are a priori unstructured, i.e., beyond the asymptotic iid setting. We present a composable security proof against coherent attacks in the finite-size regime for a general DMCVQKD protocol. We introduce a framework to handle states that are in part iid and in part unstructured (almost iid) in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces. We use a de Finetti reduction for infinite dimensional almost iid states (Renner, R., Cirac, J. I., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 110504 (2009)), and generalise the acceptance test and the energy test to almost iid states handling Eve’s correlated infinite dimensional side information. As work in progress, we address the issue of a missing chain rule that formulates an explicit key rate expression. Numerical simulation of key rates (Winick, A. et. al., Quantum 2, 77 (2018)) can then be performed, demonstrating the efficacy of the security proof.",

        "abstract": "Quantum photonic integrated circuits (QPICs) operating at telecommunication wavelengths hold great potential for large-scale deployment of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Low-propagation loss materials, such as LiNbO3, SiNx, Si, AlN, allow for high-efficiency waveguide-based optical circuits, including phase/intensity modulator, beam splitter, and polarization controller, on a semiconductor wafer. To realize a QPIC-based QKD chip, photodetectors should be integrated onto optical circuits fabricated with low propagation loss materials.  In this study, we discuss the heterogeneous integration technology of III-V photodetectors on low propagation loss materials. Particularly, we demonstrated InGaA/InAs/InGaAs quantum well (InAs QW) phototransistors integrated onto Si substrates through wafer bonding and layer transfer techniques. Our InAs QW phototransistors can detect low-intensity light at a wavelength of 1.55 um owing to their photoconductive gain based on photovoltaic effects. The photovoltaic effects in phototransistor induce a threshold voltage shift because the holes accumulate in the transistor body under light illumination. The threshold voltage shift results in a higher photocurrent than the number of photo-generated carriers under light illumination at a 1.55 um wavelength. This implies that high transconductance is desirable to obtain a high photocurrent for the phototransistor. We achieved the high responsivity in our phototransistors by optimizing InAs channel structure featuring superior transconductance characteristics (2).  For future work, we will integrate InAs QW photodetectors with membrane and nanowire structures onto waveguide-based optical circuits fabricated with low propagation loss materials. We believe that our proposed phototransistor will help to demonstrate a high performance power monitoring system in QPIC.",

        "abstract": "In device-independent cryptography, it is known that reuse of devices across multiple protocol instances can introduce a vulnerability against memory attacks. We highlight in this work that device-dependent or measurement-device-independent protocols are in fact also susceptible to similar attacks. Furthermore, even if we only consider a single protocol instance, memory effects across rounds are enough to cause substantial difficulties in applying many existing non-IID proof techniques for device-dependent or measurement-device-independent protocols, such as de Finetti reductions and complementarity-based arguments (e.g. analysis of phase errors). We present a quick discussion of these issues, including some tailored scenarios where protocols admitting security proofs via those techniques become insecure when memory effects are allowed, and we highlight connections to recently discussed attacks on DIQKD protocols that have public announcements based on the measurement outcomes. This discussion indicates the challenges that would need to be addressed in order to apply those techniques in the presence of memory effects (for either the device-dependent or device-independent case), whether for devices reused across multiple protocol instances, or for a single protocol instance.",

However, strings generated by PRNGs are always computable, representing a fatal flaw for their use in cryptographic protocols. For this reason, we designed a QRNG protocol that generates maximally unpredictable strings by localising value indefiniteness, therefore having a provable advantage over any PRNG. Moreover, a photonic implementation without the need for entanglement is possible for this approach, making it suitable for practical applications. However, the role of errors in an operational photonic embodiment is yet to be fully understood. Thus, this work aims to start the development of an error analysis framework to guarantee incomputability even in the presence of experimental imperfections.",

A ‘game’ is a generalised term referring to a mathematical model involving players who follow a structured set of rules. Classical games can be shifted to their quantum versions via a quantisation protocol. These protocols involve the employment of entangled or complex super-positioned states. Quantum game theory offers potentially beneficial properties to games that cannot be realised in their classical counterparts. This draws interest in turning classical games into quantum games and investigating whether favourable behaviours arise. We focus on the classical game known as strategic information transmission (1).

        "abstract": "Over the last decades, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) has risen as a promising solution for secure communications, a pressing subject in the aftermath of the security threat posed by Quantum Computers and the Shor's Algorithm. Offering a theoretically secure way to share secret keys between parties, QKD state of the art has witnessed remarkable progress in the last years. Nonetheless, although theoretically secure, QKD is not implementation-secure and until now, the study of physical vulnerabilities in QKD setups has mainly focused on the optical channel. The concept of attacking a cryptographic system via its physical characteristics and associated leakages, known as side-channel analysis, was firstly introduced in classical cryptography, with the seminal work of Paul Kosher. Since then, power and electromagnetic side-channel analysis have become a staple in classical cryptanalysis. However, these concepts have hardly been applied to QKD. In this work, we propose and implement a new method for side-channel analysis on QKD systems, by exploiting the power consumption of the electronic driver controlling the electro-optical components of the QKD transmitter. For high-rate transmission, QKD modules typically require electronic drivers, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Here, we will show that the FPGA's power consumption can leak information about the QKD operation, and consequently the transmitted key. The analysis was performed on the QKD transmitter at the University of Padua. Our results are consistent and show critical information leakage, having reached a maximum accuracy of 73.35% in the prediction of transmitted random keys at 100 MHz repetition frequency.",

        "abstract": "Recently, different modulator-free decoy-state quantum key distribution transmitters have been proposed. Among their advantages, they are essentially immune to information leakage, including that potentially induced by an adversary via e.g. a Trojan-horse attack. However, practical implementations of these transmitters emit, in addition to the desired signals, some extra pulses that are not used as quantum carriers, but still may contain sensitive information about the intensity and bit/basis encoding of the signals. This unwanted pulses can be actively blocked with an intensity modulator (or an optical switch), but the extinction ratio of these devices is always finite, and thus it is still crucial to account for the residual amount of information leakage at the security-proof level. In this work, we analyze the security of these transmitters and evaluate their performance in the presence of this kind of inherent information leakage. We find that the secret-key rate of the protocol is severely affected when the information leakage is not sufficiently attenuated, which highlights the importance of accounting for such type of imperfections.",

        "title": "Performance Degradation in Polarizationn Encoded Quantum Key Distribution by Polarization Dependent Loss",
        "abstract": "Since the first quantum key distribution (QKD) BB84 was proposed, various relevant QKD systems have been proposed. The systems mainly are implemented based on bulk-optics. The bulk-optics based implementation has large volume, heavy weight, high power consumption, and high cost, so that it is not easy to compatible to current communication system and is hard to be commercialized. In order to overcome the aforementioned, recently photonic integrated chip (PIC) based implementation of QKD systems have been proposed. Unfortunately, PIC based implementation has inevitable polarization depende loss (PDL), which can be induced by imperfect fabrication of waveguide, or plasma dispersion effect which can change absorption in case of a polarization modulator. Additionally, a QKD system currently cannot be implemented with only PIC so that it requires additional optical components that has PDL as well. PDL may cause the severe performance degradation of QKD, by destroying the mutually unbiasedness between the states in QKD and increasing quantum bit error rate (QBER).  In this study, we analyze effect of PDL in QKD. First, we experimentally analyze state change of polarization qubit depending on PDL which can be emulated by a PDL emulator. Based on this, we theoretically calculate intrinsic quantum bit error rate (QBER) and the corresponding secure key rate of QKD.",

        "abstract": "With the maturity of Quantum Technologies, namely Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG), there has been mounting interest in scalable and inexpensive solutions for both academia and industry. To address the practicality and security requirements for QRNGs, we are developing a self-testing QRNG system based on homodyne detection with a fully integrated optical set-up. We use an Indium Phosphide (InP) photonic integrated circuit (PIC) with a high-speed 2.5GHz phase modulation that was designed and developed in collaboration with HHI Fraunhofer. All optical components are integrated in a 12×10 mm2 chip. It is then glued to a PCB designed in-house with electrical connections to the chip for full control and read-out of the results of the homodyne measurements. Another PCB, also designed in-house, is used to interface between the PIC and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), which determines the quantum states to be prepared and reads out the homodyne detection. A graphics processing unit (GPU) connected to the FPGA then performs the statistical analysis of the data. The system operates at 1.25GHz and extraction rates above 18% are expected.",

        "abstract": "Single-photon avalanche photodiodes (SPADs) are ubiquitous in many photon-counting and low-light sensing applications including quantum key distribution (QKD) which is the most commercially advanced quantum technology.  The performance of these systems is however limited by the detection rate of the SPAD detectors, which is in turn limited by the deadtime which is applied. This is necessary due to afterpulsing, an effect which causes spurious detections due to the thermal excitation of trapped charge carriers in defect states in the SPAD. Characterisation of these defect states is therefore essential to improving material quality and hence the performance of detectors and their associated uses such as QKD. This work will present several measurements performed on InGaAs SPADs to characterise their defect states.",

Among the optical transmission windows in the atmosphere, 785nm was selected as the wavelength of the quantum channel due to its availability for high-performance silicon-based single-photon avalanche diodes and laser diodes. Additionally, 1550nm was selected for beam tracking and synchronization signal for its availability in commercial transceivers and optical amplifiers. The operation speed of the system was 100 MHz. The sifted key rate and quantum bit error rate (QBER) were measured in real-time by a field programmable gate array(FPGA). The system was installed in an indoor laboratory, and the QBER and sifted key rate were measured while increasing channel attenuation to test the system’s performance in lossy environments. We obtained superior QKD performance with a QBER of 0.62% and a sifted key rate of 1.61 Mbps at no attenuation, and 5.64% and 5.69 kbps at 25dB attenuation, showing potential application for outdoor operation over longer distances.",

        "abstract": "The decoy-state method is a prominent approach to enhance the performance of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems that operate with weak coherent laser sources. Current experimental decoy-state QKD setups increase their secret key rate by raising the repetition rate of the transmitter, which can lead to correlations between subsequently emitted optical pulses. This phenomenon leaks information about the encoding settings, including the intensities of the generated signals, thus invalidating a basic premise of decoy-state QKD. Here, we experimentally characterize intensity correlations between the nearest-neigbouring optical pulses in two commercial prototypes of decoy-state BB84 QKD systems and show that they significantly reduce the asymptotic key rate. In addition, we study intensity correlations between pulses spaced further apart (higher-order correlations) and find that, in contrast to what has been conjectured, their impact on the intensity of the generated signals can be much higher than that of the nearest-neighbour (first-order) correlations.",

        "abstract": "For quantum communication applications, time-to-digital converters (TDCs) are a crucial tool whose performance can severely affect the quality of the entire application. Nowadays, FPGA-based TDCs present a viable alternative to ASIC ones, once the nonlinear behaviour due to the intrinsic nature of the device is properly mitigated. To compensate said nonlinearities, a calibration procedure is required. Maintaining this calibration consistent during long measurements requires either interpolation methods or stopping data acquisition for a fixed time to perform the calibration process. Here we present a design and demonstration of an FPGA-based TDC  showing a residual jitter of 27 ps, that is scalable for multichannel operation.  We present a unique calibration method that exploits single-photon detection, which does not require stopping the data acquisition or using any interpolation methods, while keeping the device calibrated to the best of its ability. This allows Bob to receive time-tags with the best possible accuracy while also removing data-loss phases. This calibration method was tested in a relevant environment, investigating the device behaviour between 5 °C and 80 °C, where the residual jitter of the TDC was shown to be kept under control.",

The distance of point-to-point QKD secure key distribution is primarily impeded by the transmission loss inherent to the channel. In the quest to realize a large-scale quantum network, increasing the QKD distance under current technology is of great research interest. Here we adopt the 3-intensity sending-or-not-sending twin-field QKD (TF-QKD) protocol with the actively-odd-parity-pairing method. The experiment demonstrates the feasibility of secure QKD over a 1002 km fibre channel considering the finite size effect. The secure key rate is $3.11 10^{-12}$ per pulse at this distance. Furthermore, by optimizing parameters for shorter fiber distances, we conducted performance tests on key distribution for fiber lengths ranging from 202 km to 505 km. Notably, the secure key rate for the 202 km, the normal distance between major cities, reached 111.74 kbps.",

We conducted a field trial of an intermodal quantum key distribution system, featuring two polarization-based transmitters and a single receiver. In this trial, the active channel was alternately switched between a 620-meter free-space link and a 17-kilometer deployed fiber in the metropolitan area of Padova. The free-space channel's performance was assessed in relation to atmospheric turbulence strength. The field trial, conducted over several hours in daylight, demonstrated the intermodal functionality between fiber and free-space channels. Our switching system offers a cost-effective solution for a trusted quantum key distribution network, minimizing the number of necessary devices across different network topologies.",

        "abstract": "Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) uses continuous variables of the electromagnetic field, such as amplitude and phase, to transmit quantum information between two users, Alice and Bob. In this regime, there are two standard practical implementations: the transmitted local oscillator (TLO) and the local-local oscillator (LLO), where the LLO has recently reached 100km in laboratory-based fibre. Despite this success, the LLO also suffers major disadvantages like reduced quantum signal bandwidth capacity. Typically, only 50% of the transmission is for exchanging common phase references between Alice and Bob using reference signals. Subsequently, the key rate is reduced by half over all the transmission distances. In this work, we propose using a machine learning algorithm such as Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) to predict the reference phase. The algorithm is trained with a sufficient number of phase reference data. Then, it predicts the phase drift with minimal usage of the reference signals, thereby reducing the reference signal bandwidth and increasing the key rate.",

        "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a secure communication method that uses quantum mechanics principles to exchange keys between parties. The security of QKD relies on the fundamental properties of quantum physics, making it a crucial technology for achieving highly secure data transmission, in particular in the quantum computer era.  Among the impediments of the use of QKD in complex and inter-connected networks is the limited key rate provided by such system, the limited distance between two nodes that want to communicate and the need of confidentiality within the trusted relay. When QKD is implemented in large size networks, running on long distances, the usual solution is to use a lot of intermediate nodes with the consequence of reducing the performance and increasing the need of security inside these intermediate nodes. However, it is still extremely interesting for a user to implement the QKD in such types of topologies because of the high security it allows despite the limitation in bandwidth and the complexity in network topology.  We propose a new approach to solve the above-mentioned problems. The core of the solution is to develop a key distribution system that can operate in a new mode; multiplying the bandwidth, in any network topology, while basing the overall security on QKD-exchanged keys.",

In this demonstration, we developed the infrastructure needed to connect commercial off-the-shelf quantum key distribution (QKD) systems into a four-site, multi-vendor mesh network shared by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Verizon Communications in the Boston metropolitan area. Encrypted network links leverage QKD-enabled protocol suites, including IPsec and MACsec with data transfer rates up to 100 Gbps connecting on-premises locations to the cloud edge via the AWS Direct Connect service. Detailed health and performance monitoring data gathered over half a year allow for gap analysis with today’s current commercial quantum network technologies. Coupled with symmetric encryption key demand forecasts, this sets the foundation for defining the paths forward to meet carrier-grade network redundancy and resilience requirements.",

A major research path is minimizing the required assumptions to achieve OT, and studying their consequences. Regarding its computation, it is impossible to construct unconditionally-secure OT without extra assumptions; and, regarding communication complexity, achieving one-shot (and even non-interactive) OT has proved to be an elusive task, widely known to be impossible classically. In this work, we devise a extit{one-shot OT}, showig how this construction is indeed possible using quantum resources, if we assume the existence of one-way functions and sequential functions in the Noisy-Quantum-Storage Model.",

        "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) with solid-state single-photon emitters is gaining traction due to their rapidly improving performance and compatibility with future quantum networks. We report a bright quantum dot based source of telecom photons by frequency converting a near- infrared InGaAs quantum dot to the telecom C-band (1). We implement polarisation encoded BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD), achieving a positive asymptotic key rate over 175 km of optical fibre. We also present finite key analysis optimised for typically non-ideal single- photon sources, achieving 8 orders of magnitude improvement with finite key rates of 40 kbps over 50 km in practical acquisition times of one hour (2). To extend the distances further, we take inspiration from decoy state QKD protocols – typically used to overcome photon- splitting attacks when using weak coherent states – and demonstrate a QD excitation scheme for implementing modulation of the photon number distribution. We show experimentally that the decoy state protocol enables the distribution of a secret key over more than 200 km of optical fibre.",

The security of QKD protocols is often analyzed by bounding the probability of a \"failure\" during the parameter estimation step. This failure probability is typically addressed using tail bounds on the hypergeometric distribution. However, existing methods can sometimes be conservative, leading to inefficiencies. In this work, we present an alternative approach that provides a more refined bound by exploiting a simple yet effective link between hypergeometric and binomial random variables.",

        "abstract": "Advancements in quantum computing pose significant threats to the security of conventional encryption standards. Although quantum key distribution systems offer inherent security, they face challenges in achieving practical secret-key rates over long transmission distances (2). Multiplexing schemes can substantially enhance key rates, and integrated photonic chip technologies provide the necessary scalability and system efficiency for high key rates using wavelength-division time-bin protocols. We propose a hybrid sender module that employs on-chip lasers and fast modulators on the indium-phosphide platform for qubit state preparation. The multiplexer is fabricated on a low-loss silicon nitride chip, utilizing ring resonators and Bragg reflectors. We report progress in developing a sender module designed to achieve secret key rates in the gigabit per second range. Additionally, the system is compatible with a receiver that integrates waveguide-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors with on-chip de-multiplexing, ensuring high detection efficiency and key rates (1). This design supports the implementation of protocols such as the one-decoy state time-bin BB84 protocol and promises further scalability.",

To achieve intercontinental coverage with available technology one must adopt a “flying trusted node” paradigm, in which users fully trust the satellite platform. The major part of the poster will focus on our latest work where inspired by the concept of distributed secret sharing and the imminent projected launch of several QKD-equipped satellites, we proposed a parallel trusted node approach, in which key distribution is mediated by several satellites in parallel. This distributes the trust, removes single points of failure, and reduces the necessary assumptions. In addition, we discussed the versatility that an optical ground station should provide to execute such a protocol and, in general, to be fully integrated into a multi-party global quantum network. Finally, one last section of the poster will focus on how we will implement the idea of versatility and adaptability at the Abu Dhabi Quantum Optical Ground Station from a hardware perspective.",

Nevertheless, DI-QKD, for now, remains extremely challenging. The first proof-of-principle experiments having been performed only very recently, almost 40 years after the invention of BB84. It then becomes naturally interesting to study scenarios which may reach a compromise between experimental challenge and security: for example, by assuming than the users have a partial description of the devices. This intermediate scenario is called semi-device-independent (SDI) QKD and aims for a reasonable trade-off between the highest level of security, device-independence, and experimental feasibility.",

We simulate these protocols in a Weak Coherent Pulse (WCP) implementation in order to characterize their behaviour in a realistic implementation without decoy states. We vary the quantum channel characteristics and compare key rates of the three protocols in asymptotic and finite-size regimes. The three protocols show different relative advantages depending on the channel behaviour. Canonical BB84 shows robustness against errors and depolarization, SARG04 demonstrates resilience against high loss channels and NPAB BB84 shows potential advantages when we introduce physical misalignment between QKD devices.",

Quantum key distribution is the used protocol, however, is costly and, at the moment, offers low performance in space applications. Other more recent protocols could offer a potential practical solution to this problem. In this work, a preliminary optical payload design using commercial off-the-shelf elements for a quantum communication downlink in a 3U CubeSat is proposed. It is shown that this quantum state emitter allows the establishment of two types of quantum communication between the satellite and the ground station: quantum key distribution and quantum keyless private communication. Numerical simulations are provided that show the feasibility of the scheme for both protocols as well as their performance. For the simplified BB84, a maximum secret key rate of about 80 kHz and minimum QBER of slightly more than 0.07 % is found, at the zenith, while for quantum private keyless communication, a 700 MHz private rate is achieved. This design serves as a platform for the implementation of novel quantum communication protocols that can improve the performance of quantum communications in space.",

The center of the network will be the AlbaNova hub, which will also be open to selected users to test the QKD technology. From there, fiber links will reach two nodes in the metropolitan area (<20 km in length) and two longer distance points (80-150 km-long links), which will require also a trusted node. The network will use both continuous and discrete-variable devices, the latter being augmented by superconducting nanowire detectors. Furthermore, we are refurbishing an astronomical telescope to serve as an optical ground station for QKD, giving satellite-tracking capabilities. The project has also goals that go beyond deployment. One is advancing research in quantum communication with a study of stabilization techniques for twin field QKD and of noise contribution hindering different QKD protocols, and the other is forming the Swedish quantum work force through coordinated courses, seminars, and outreach events. This poster gives an overview of the entire project.",

Since the original BB84 protocol was proposed, various other protocols have been developed with specific hardware requirements on the quantum layer. However, in general time synchronisation and a classical communications channel remain core ancillary requirements of QKD on the typically classical support layer. The White Rabbit (WR) technology, developed at CERN, provides a convenient means to achieve sub-nanosecond timing synchronisation over optical fibre. In order to enhance its suitability as an ancillary system to QKD, we demonstrate a significant extension of the range of WR over a single uninterrupted stretch of fibre to 250 km, and report on our success in transferring the timing accuracy of WR to coordinating a simultaneous 'start time' between Alice and Bob.",

This scheme is well suited to building the global-scale quantum network that suffers from extremely high channel loss. Since it was proposed, fiber-based demonstrations have been rapidly developed. However, TF-QKD over a free-space channel remains experimentally challenging due to the effect of atmospheric turbulence. Here, we realized the first free-space TF-QKD protocol over two 7.1-km urban atmospheric channels, which exceeds the effective atmospheric thickness. A secure key rate exceeding the repeaterless secret key capacity was demonstrated. By controlling the time and phase of optical pulses through the open channel, our setup avoids the requirement of an additional channel to construct a closed interferometer. Our experiment takes a significant step toward the satellite-based global quantum network with a high level of practical security.",

        "abstract": "Twin-field quantum key distribution (TF-QKD) allows a secure key rate to break the repeaterless bound, which is known as the Pirandola-Laurenza-Ottaviani-Bianchi (PLOB) bound. Together with the security of measurement device independence, it is important in the future global quantum network. TF-QKD requires single photon interference between two independent optical fields transmitted through different channels. In free-space channels, atmospheric turbulence strongly disturbs the laser beam's wavefront, leading to a significant intensity fluctuation of received photons. This random fluctuation causes intensity distinguishability between two beams, thus reducing the visibility of interference and the secure key rate. Here, we proposed a scheme to increase the secure key rate under such unstable channels. The characteristics, especially the intensity fluctuation, of free-space channels are presented. Numerical analysis is performed to demonstrate the improvement of the secure key rate with our strategy. The result shows that, under a typical atmospheric condition of 14 km distance, the secure key rate of TF-QKD can be increased to 3.75 times. Our method can be a general tool widely used in the future long-distance horizontal or satellite-based free-space quantum key distribution.",

        "abstract": "Quantum networks use platforms like quantum repeaters to enable quantum communications at arbitrary distances. Early quantum networks are expected to be deployed on pre-existing infrastructure, sharing resources with classical networks, and thus can benefit from compatible design principles and behaviours. In particular, most of the research on quantum repeater networks based on entanglement distribution assume that some connection is established in order to reserve resources for the distribution attempt. However, the most prominent classical network, the Internet, is built upon the concept of connectionless communications, and therefore this approach might not be ideal for the early stages of deployment. In our work, we investigate the performance of connectionless protocols over quantum networks. To do so, we consider both unencoded (standard) but deterministic repeaters, and repeaters using a 3-quit repetition code. We analyse the achievable secret key rates for both of these setups in different regimes of errors. Our results suggest that error correction techniques such as the usage of encoded quantum repeaters will be crucial to the success of early quantum networks.",

        "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols leverage quantum mechanics to achieve information theoretically secure communication, yet real-world implementations must address experimental limitations, particularly phase correlations in weak coherent laser pulses (WCPs). High-speed gain-switching lasers, commonly used in QKD, can exhibit residual photons causing phase correlations between consecutive pulses, challenging the perfect phase randomization assumption crucial for the decoy-state BB84 protocol. Theoretical work has proposed security proofs that require knowledge of how closely each phase's probability distribution approximates uniformity, which is complex to estimate experimentally. In this study we introduce an experimental method to characterise phase correlations of any length under realistic conditions by modelling the phase generation process within the laser cavity. Additionally, we experimentally benchmark this practical routine for measuring second-order correlations using a double Michelson interferometer with tunable amplitude attenuators, allowing comprehensive characterisation of the phase generation process and accurate measurement of the phase probability distribution, thus enhancing the security of QKD systems.",

        "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can be performed securely only when the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) is below a certain threshold which, due to the unavoidable presence of noise, limits the maximum transmission distance. Advantage Distillation (AD) is a classical post-processing technique that enhances QKD protocols by increasing error tolerance, thus extending the communication range. AD operates by post-selecting blocks of bits and extracting fewer correlated bits between Alice and Bob, which exhibits a reduced QBER, while Eve's mutual information does not significantly increase. This process ultimately lowers the information disclosure in the information reconciliation step, while the relative key shortening during privacy amplification remains largely unaffected. In this study, we present the first comprehensive finite key size analysis of the decoy-state version of the BB84 protocol including AD post-processing. Our results demonstrate a notable improvement in QBER tolerance through AD, with the 1-decoy version outperforming the 2-decoy version of the protocol. This analysis has significant implications for long-distance and satellite-based QKD applications, which are constrained by QBER, as it shows that substantial performance enhancements can be achieved by improved post-processing techniques.",

The source is highly non-degenerate to accommodate transmission in both fiber and free space. This source is intended for use in QKD applications. To achieve this, we explain and characterize the dependence on the temperature, poling period, phase matching, temporal walk-off, beam waist and the expected performance of this source.",

        "abstract": "The trusted device scenario is the assumption that an adversary cannot access imperfections in the detectors such as electronic noise, aiming at improving the key rate of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. In the case of trusted Gaussian noises in the detectors of continuous-variable (CV) QKD, there is a method based on rescaling that is applicable to any protocol using homodyne or heterodyne detectors. Here, we are interested in what kind of CV-QKD protocols tend to benefit more from the trusted scenario. Using prior research that extended the covariance matrix analysis from Gaussian modulation to discrete modulation, we evaluated the quantitative effect of rescaling on the key rate with arbitrary modulation. Our results revealed that the performance asymptotically improves in any discrete modulation protocol, and this improvement is more significant compared to Gaussian modulation. Additionally, we developed a method to address unbalanced heterodyne measurements, where the noise and transmittance of the two homodyne detectors differ. This allows for a more realistic measurement model to be addressed with discrete modulation.",

        "abstract": "The conditional disclosure of secrets (CDS) primitive is among the simplest cryptographic settings in which to study the relationship between communication, randomness, and security. CDS involves two parties, Alice and Bob, who do not communicate but who wish to reveal a secret $z$ to a referee if and only if a Boolean function $f$ has $f(x,y)=1$. Alice knows $x,z$, Bob knows $y$, and the referee knows $x,y$. Recently, a quantum analogue of this primitive called CDQS was defined and related to $f$-routing, a task studied in the context of quantum position-verification. CDQS has the same inputs, outputs, and communication pattern as CDS but allows the use of shared entanglement and quantum messages. We initiate the systematic study of CDQS, with the aim of better understanding the relationship between privacy and quantum resources in the information theoretic setting. Following the classical literature on CDS for guidance, we establish closure under negation, an amplification property, and prove a number of lower bounds on CDQS based on communication complexity.",
